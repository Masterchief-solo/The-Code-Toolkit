# 🛠️ The Code Toolkit 🛠️ 
### Your everyday, trusty scripts and commands for IT Tech shenanigans


## 🎯 What's This All About?

If you're like me, you want to make things easier on the job. This repository is the result of hours of research and testing spent on everyday tasks that we IT folks deal with. Whether you're managing a small network, troubleshooting workstations, or just trying to make your tech life easier, you might find something useful here.

Think of it as that drawer of useful tools we all have - except it's full of scripts instead of screwdrivers!

## 🚀 Features

What you'll (maybe) find:

### 🖥️ System Administration
- Active Directory management 
- Network diagnostics
- Backup and recovery

### 🔍 Monitoring & Maintenance
- Resource usage trackers
- Log parsing utilities
- Health check scripts

### 🤖 Automation Scripts
- User management automation
- Scheduling tasks
- Routine maintenance tasks

## 📁 Script Categories

Everything's organized into practical directories:
```
📁 system_admin/
📁 monitoring/
📁 automation/
📁 network/
📁 security/
📁 data_analysis/
```

## 🎮 Usage

Each script has its own README with specific usage instructions. I also hope to provide adequate comments detailing code functions and processes, but that isn't always promised.
